## Usage

### Prerequisites

* face_recognition<=1.3.0
* numpy<=1.23.5
* opencv_python<=4.7.0.72
* pandas<=2.0.2
* tensorflow==2.15.0.post1
* streamlit<=1.23.1 (Optional - for demo)

### Areas of Usage

1. **Media Integrity Verification:**
   - Verify the authenticity of images and videos in the media industry to ensure integrity and trustworthiness.

2. **Social Media Content Moderation:**
   - Enhance content moderation on social media platforms by detecting and preventing the spread of deepfake content.

3. **Security and Surveillance:**
   - Strengthen security and surveillance systems by identifying manipulated visuals that could compromise the accuracy of facial recognition and surveillance technologies.
   

### Loading the Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf

## Load the ReDeepFake model
redeepfake_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('redeepfake_model.h5')
```

### Preprocessing the Input Image
```python
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (224, 224))
    img = tf.keras.applications.efficientnet.preprocess_input(img)
    return img
```

### Making Predictions

```python
# 'image' -> preprocessed input image data
prediction = redeepfake_model.predict(image)
```

## Model Limitations

1. The model's performance may be influenced by variations in lighting conditions, image quality, and diverse facial expressions.

2. It may not be fully robust against emerging deepfake generation techniques: Modern image generation methods use advanced descriptors to assess the quality of the image's realism, so photos of such faces are difficult to distinguish from real people. 

3. Deepfakes made by using 3D image processing technologies and manually modified images by the authors cannot be recognized correctly by the model.

## Ethics

1. **Informed Consent:**
   - Ensure that individuals involved in the data used for training and testing the model have given informed consent for their images to be used. Respect privacy and obtain explicit permission when necessary.

2. **Responsible Disclosure:**
   - If the model identifies potential deepfake content related to an individual, exercise responsible disclosure. Notify the concerned parties or relevant authorities in a timely and responsible manner, allowing them to address the situation appropriately.

3. **Avoid Unlawful Use:**
   - Do not use the ReDeepFake model for any activities that violate laws, regulations, or ethical standards. Prohibit the use of the model for malicious purposes, such as generating harmful deepfake content or engaging in activities that infringe on privacy rights.
