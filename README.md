## Overview

**Model Name:** `ReDeepFake`

**Task:** Advanced Deepfake detection model for 2D flat images.

**Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -> [EfficientNetB4](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/efficientnet) Model Architecture based.

**Framework:** `TensorFlow`

**Current Version:** V1.3

**Key Study:** [Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deepfake-detection-challenge) (in 2019-2020, by Meta, AWS, Microsoft and AIâ€™s Media Integrity Steering Committee).

**Key Parthner:** `Microsoft Imagine Cup 2024`

**Research Paper:** will be here very soon..

## Description

ReDeepFake is a deep learning model designed for the purpose of detecting deepfake content within 2D flat images. Leveraging EfficientNetB4 advanced CNN architecture, the model is trained to discern subtle patterns indicative of deepfake manipulation.

## Key Features

- **Architecture:** Utilizes EfficientNetB4 model architecture with a custom-designed additional layers. ReDeepFake model architecture shown below in the figure:

- **Training Data:** Pre-processed dataset of 224x224 resized real/fake image from DFDC competition was used for training our `ReDeepFake` model.

- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated based on `Accuracy` and `F1-score`.
  - **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified images.

  - **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    - **Precision:** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
    - **Recall:** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* face_recognition<=1.3.0
* numpy<=1.23.5
* opencv_python<=4.7.0.72
* pandas<=2.0.2
* tensorflow==2.15.0.post1
* streamlit<=1.23.1 (Optional - for demo)

### Loading the Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf

## Load the ReDeepFake model
redeepfake_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('redeepfake_model.h5')
```

## Making Predictions

```python
# 'image' -> preprocessed input image data
prediction = redeepfake_model.predict(image)
```

## Model Limitations

1. The model's performance may be influenced by variations in lighting conditions, image quality, and diverse facial expressions.

2. It may not be fully robust against emerging deepfake generation techniques: Modern image generation methods use advanced descriptors to assess the quality of the image's realism, so photos of such faces are difficult to distinguish from real people. 

3. Deepfakes made by using 3D image processing technologies and manually modified images by the authors cannot be recognized correctly by the model.
